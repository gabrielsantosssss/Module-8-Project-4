This project implements a simple game object in JavaScript, which includes properties for lives and coins, and methods for managing the game's state.
`lives`: Initially set to 3, representing the number of lives the player has.
`coins`: Initially set to 0, representing the number of coins the player has collected.
`points`: Returns the total points, calculated as `coins * 10`.
`playerDies()`: Decreases the number of lives by 1 if the player has more than 0 lives.
`newGame()`: Resets the game state by setting lives to 3 and coins to 0.
