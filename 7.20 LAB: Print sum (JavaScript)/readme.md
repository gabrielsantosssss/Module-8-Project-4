The printSum function takes two parameters, x and y, and performs the following tasks based on their types:
Converts x and y to numbers using parseFloat.
Checks if x and y are valid numbers using isNaN.
Outputs messages to the console based on the types of x and y:
If both x and y are numbers, it prints their sum.
If neither x nor y are numbers, it indicates that both are not numbers.
If only x is not a number, it specifies that x is not a number.
If only y is not a number, it specifies that y is not a number.
