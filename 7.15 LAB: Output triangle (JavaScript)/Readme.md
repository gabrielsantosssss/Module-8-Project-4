This project contains a JavaScript function `drawTriangle` that draws a right-angled triangle made of asterisks (`*`). The size of the triangle (the number of lines) is determined by the `triangleSize` parameter. The project includes the implementation of the function, along with a test case to demonstrate its functionality. The `drawTriangle` function takes a single parameter `triangleSize`, which specifies the number of lines the triangle should have. The function then outputs a right-angled triangle to the console, where each line contains one more asterisk than the previous line.The function uses nested loops. The outer loop iterates through the number of lines specified by `triangleSize`. The inner loop constructs each line by concatenating asterisks into a string.
