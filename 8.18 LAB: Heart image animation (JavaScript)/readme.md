Start animation on mouse click: When the user clicks anywhere on the webpage, the image starts moving towards the click position. Smooth animation: The image moves pixel by pixel towards the clicked position until it reaches it. Stop animation: If the user clicks again while the image is already animating towards a previous click position, the current animation stops and starts a new one towards the new click position. Event Listener Listens for the DOMContentLoaded event to ensure the DOM is fully loaded before executing. Start Animation Function (`startAnimation`) Triggered on a click event anywhere on the document. Retrieves mouse coordinates and starts a timer to continuously move the image towards the clicked position using the `moveImage` function.Move Image Function (`moveImage`) Calculates the current position of the image and adjusts it pixel by pixel towards the target coordinates (`centerX`, `centerY`). Stops the animation when the image reaches the target coordinates. Timer Management Uses `setInterval` and `clearInterval` to control the animation loop based on the timer ID (`timerId`).
